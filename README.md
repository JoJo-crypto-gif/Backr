In vscode open a new terminal (bash) and navigate to backend "cd backend" and then enter this command "npm install" to install all backend depencies
Enter this command "node server.js" to start backend server, in the terminal you should see the server connect and database connected
copy and search the url to confirm... probably on localhost:3000
